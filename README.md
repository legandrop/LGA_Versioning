# LGA Versioning

This batch script automates the versioning process for LGA projects.

## Usage

1. Drag and drop the file you want to version onto `LGA_Versioning.bat`.
2. If it doesn't exist, the script creates a new folder called "+OLD".
3. Inside this folder, it copies the dragged file with a new version number.
4. If no previous version exists, it starts with v1.0.
